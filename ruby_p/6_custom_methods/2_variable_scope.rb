# variables that are defined inside a method are local variables
# method's local variables can't be accessd outside of that method
# If we want to use outside variable inside a method 
# .. we need to use different variable type that is an instance type variable
# We can also pass in outside variables as arguments

#?? Can variables set outside be accessed from inside the method?
